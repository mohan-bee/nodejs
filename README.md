# Node.js

## Core Concepts

- [x] Event Loop
- [x] Streams (Readable/Writable, Piping, Backpressure)
- [ ] Clusters (Scaling across CPU cores)
- [ ] Worker Threads (Parallelism in Node.js)
- [ ] Error Handling (Sync vs Async, Global Error Handlers)
- [ ] Buffers & Binary Data

---

## Intermediate Topics

- [ ] Async Patterns (Callbacks, Promises, async/await)
- [ ] EventEmitter (Custom Events, Observers)
- [ ] Child Processes & IPC (run heavy tasks in background)
- [ ] File System (`fs` module — sync vs async, streams)
- [ ] HTTP Module (Build servers from scratch)
- [ ] Custom Middleware & Routing (Express/Fastify)
- [ ] N-API / Native Addons (Integrate C++ modules)

---

## Security & Performance

- [ ] Security Best Practices (Helmet, rate limiting, validation)
- [ ] Performance Optimization (Profiling, memory leaks, event loop lag)
- [ ] Caching (Redis, In-memory)
- [ ] Load Testing (Artillery, K6)
- [ ] Environment Variables & Secrets Management

---

## Networking & APIs

- [ ] REST API Design (Express/Fastify)
- [ ] GraphQL (Apollo Server)
- [ ] WebSockets (Socket.io)
- [ ] gRPC (Microservice Communication)

---

## System Design with Node.js

- [ ] Scalability Patterns (Microservices, Message Queues)
- [ ] Containerization (Docker, PM2)
- [ ] CI/CD Basics (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- [ ] Database Integration (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma/Sequelize)
- [ ] Logging & Monitoring (Winston, Morgan, Sentry)

---

## Testing & Quality

- [ ] Unit Testing (Jest, Mocha)
- [ ] Integration Testing (Supertest)
- [ ] Test Coverage & Mocking
- [ ] Linting & Code Style (ESLint, Prettier)

---

## Advanced Internals

- [ ] Node.js Internals (V8, libuv, Node runtime)
- [ ] Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Middleware)
- [ ] Event Loop Deep Dive (Timers, I/O callbacks, microtasks)
- [ ] Understanding Garbage Collection in V8

---

## Suggested Learning Order

1. Streams → Error Handling → EventEmitter  
2. Worker Threads & Cluster  
3. HTTP Module + Middleware  
4. Async Patterns → Performance → Security  
5. Databases + Scaling + Testing

Goal: Be interview-ready for backend and full-stack roles by mastering both fundamentals and advanced Node.js internals.
